- 👋 Hi, I’m @Legendxgm
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and eventually become a pen tester
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics into code and beginning my course work for further education
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new projects that someone is willing to allow me to watch and learn what is being done
- 📫 How to reach me well I'll update this at some point just because I don't know how secure this is.
